# Stoodent
Stoodent is a student management system built using ASP.NET MVC. This project serves as my introduction to ASP.NET MVC and showcases my learning progress. It provides a simple interface for managing student records by leveraging a SQL Server database.

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and further improvements and enhancements are still underway.
